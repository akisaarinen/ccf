Concurrency Control Framework (CCF)
===================================

Setting up development environment:
-----------------------------------
  1. Clone the git repository
  2. Configure JVM  
  3. ./sbt update   (fetches dependencies)
  4. ./sbt test     (runs all tests)

Creating library package:
-------------------------
  ./sbt package

  This will produce the package to:
    ./ccf/target/ccf-{version}.jar

Running the test application:
-----------------------------

  The test application is a very simple collaborative text-editing application,
  consisting of a server that binds to a port and a client that connects to the
  server using HTTP. You may start multiple instances of the client application
  locally and try out how the text is updated to the other instances in real
  time. Best example of the operation is of course if you can run the client in
  two machines and just specify the same server address for both clients.


  Running the server application:

  ./sbt -p app run -s    (-s can be replaced with --server)
    
    Optional parameters for server:
    --port <port> || -p <port>

    Port defaults to 9999.


  Running the client application:

  ./sbt -p app run       (no parameters == client)
    
    Optional parameters for client:
    --host <host> || -h <host>
    --port <port> || -p <port>

    Port defaults to 9999 and host to 'localhost'.
