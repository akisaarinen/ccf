CCF is a Scala library aiming to make developing of collaborative
software easier. CCF uses operational transformation (OT) for achieving
concurrency control in systems in which collaborative editing takes
place. In addition to operational transformation, CCF offers higher
level APIs for synchronization of tree-like documents between multiple
clients over HTTP/1.1 protocol. CCF is distributed under the <a
