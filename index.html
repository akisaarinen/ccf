        <h1>CCF - Concurrency Control Framework for Scala</h1>
        <h2>What is CCF?</h2>
        <p>
        CCF is a Scala library aiming to make developing of collaborative
        software easier. CCF uses operational transformation (OT) for achieving
        concurrency control in systems in which collaborative editing takes
        place. In addition to operational transformation, CCF offers higher
        level APIs for synchronization of tree-like documents between multiple
        clients over HTTP/1.1 protocol. CCF is distributed under the <a
          href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html">Apache 2.0
          license</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>Download</h2>
        <p>
        The latest version of CCF is 0.2.0 and it was released on the 3rd of
        September, 2010. You can download the <a
          href=http://github.com/akisaarinen/ccf/tarball/v0.2.0>sources</a> or
        clone the Git <a
          href="http://github.com/akisaarinen/ccf">repository</a> by running:
        <pre> $ git clone http://github.com/akisaarinen/ccf.git</pre>

        <h2>Introduction to synchronization in collaborative editing</h2>
        <p>
        Synchronization between multiple parties in a collaborative
        group-editing system is an interesting problem that can be described
        for example as "the activity of coordinating the potentially
        interfering actions of processes that operate in parallel" [2]. Popular
        approaches for solving this problem include various locking schemes,
        global serialization of actions by a single party (usually the server)
        and finally what's called operational transformations (OT).
        </p>
        <p>
        CCF is based on one of these OT algorithms, which allow users to make
        instant changes to a local copy of the data, and then provide
        mechanisms for eventually synchronizing all of these clients in such a
        way, that intentions of all users are preserved whenever it's possible.
        Conflict situations are usually merged automatically, even though user
        interaction could be implemented when necessary.

        <h3>CCF and Jupiter</h3>
        <p>
        CCF is based on an algorithm called Jupiter. It was introduced by
        Nichols et. al in the context of the Jupiter collaboration system
        already in 1995 [1]. A variant of this same algorithm was used in the
        <a href="http://wave.google.com">Google Wave</a> collaboration
        platform. Even though various more advanced algorithms have been
        developed since the introduction of Jupiter, the relative simplicity of
        this algorithm still makes it a powerful tool even today.
